This repository contains Matlab code which reproduces numerical experiments from the manuscript

> Zvonimir Bujanović, Luka Grubišić, Daniel Kressner, Hei Yin Lam: *Subspace embedding with random Khatri-Rao products and its application to eigensolvers*.

To reproduce a result from the manuscript, please first run `set_path` in Matlab, and then the appropriate script.

The code relies on the following external dependencies:
* ADI solver for generalized Sylvester equations by Patrick Kürschner. With author's approval, this code is available in the folder `external/sylvester_ADI`.
* Tensor Toolbox for Matlab, v3.5. Available [here](https://www.tensortoolbox.org/), please download and unpack to the folder `external/tensor_toolbox-v3.5`.
